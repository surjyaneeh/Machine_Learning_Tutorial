# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are not supervised using training datasets, as the name implies. Instead, models themselves decipher the provided data to reveal hidden patterns and insights. It is comparable to the learning process that occurs in the human brain while learning something new.

Unlike supervised learning, we have the input data but no corresponding output data, unsupervised learning cannot be used to solve a regression or classification problem directly. Finding the underlying structure of a dataset, classifying the data into groups based on similarities, and representing the dataset in a compressed format are the objectives of unsupervised learning.
