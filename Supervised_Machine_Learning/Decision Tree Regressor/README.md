# Decision Tree Regressor

In machine learning, Decision Tree is one of the most efficient and widely used algorithms.

There are two types of decision tree algorithms:
* Classifier based on Decision Trees (for classification tasks)
* Regressor with a Decision Tree (for regression tasks)

There are three sorts of nodes in this tree-structured classifier. The Root Node is the first node in the graph, and it represents the complete sample. It can be further divided into nodes. The features of a data collection are represented by the interior nodes, while the decision rules are represented by the branches. Finally, the outcome is represented by the Leaf Nodes. This algorithm is quite useful for resolving decision-making issues.

A specific data point is traversed through the entire tree by answering True/False questions until it reaches the leaf node. The average of the dependent variable's value in that particular leaf node is the final forecast. The Tree is able to estimate an appropriate value for the data point after numerous iterations.
