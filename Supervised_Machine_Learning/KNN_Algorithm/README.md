# K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm

K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a machine learning technique that is basic, easy to grasp, and versatile. Both classification and regression issues are solved using the KNN algorithm. The KNN algorithm is based on feature similarity. 

KNN is a slow and non-parametric learning method. The term "non-parametric" refers to the absence of any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. To put it another way, the model structure is based on the dataset. This will be quite useful in practise, as most real-world datasets do not adhere to mathematical theoretical assumptions. The term "lazy algorithm" refers to a model generation algorithm that does not require any training data points. In the testing phase, all training data was used.
