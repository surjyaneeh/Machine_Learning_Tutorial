## Decision Tree Classifier

Decision Tree is one of the most efficient and extensively used algorithms in machine learning.

Decision tree algorithms can be divided into two categories:

1. Using Decision Trees as a Classifier (for classification tasks)
2. Using a Decision Tree as a Regressor (for regression tasks)

This tree-structured classifier has three types of nodes. The Root Node is the graph's first node, representing the entire sample. It can be subdivided further into nodes. The internal nodes reflect the features of a data collection, while the branches represent the decision rules. Finally, the Leaf Nodes represent the outcome. This method is quite helpful in resolving decision-making problems.

By answering True/False questions, a specific data point is navigated along the tree until it reaches the leaf node. The final forecast is calculated by averaging the dependent variable's value in each leaf node. After several iterations, the Tree can predict a suitable value for the data point.
