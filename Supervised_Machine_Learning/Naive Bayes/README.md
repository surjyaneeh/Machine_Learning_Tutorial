# Naive Bayes

A classifier is a machine learning model that categorizes various objects according to specific traits or variables. The Bayes theorem is used to power this particular classifier. According to naive Bayes classifiers, there is no relationship between any of the features or variables. A variable's presence or absence has no bearing on any other variable's presence or absence.

## Advantages :
It is an extremely quick method that is highly extensible.

It can be applied to multiclass classification as well as binary.

It is simple to utilize for both huge volumes of data and small dataset training.

## Disadvantages :
The fundamental drawback of the NB is that it treats all the factors that affect probability as independent.
